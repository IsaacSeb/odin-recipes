        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This carrot Bundt cake gets an extra boost of moisture and flavor thanks to the addition of both pureed and grated carrots. 
            Crushed pineapple also adds a nice bright note. 
            The cake is topped with a light, sweet cream cheese glaze. 
            Feel free to add some chopped walnuts or pecans to the batter, if you wish.
        </p>
